## Project Background

In today's life, proper management of personal finances is crucial for achieving long-term financial goals. However, many people face challenges such as inconsistent record-keeping, difficulty tracking spending patterns, or lack of effective tools to analyze their financial situation.

I decided to develop an intuitive and easy-to-use financial tracking system to help users clearly understand their income and expenses, and provide useful financial insights through visualization, assisting users in making more informed financial decisions.

## Introduction
