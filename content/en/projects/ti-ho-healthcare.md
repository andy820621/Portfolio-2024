### Project Background

In the modern internet era, corporate websites need to provide not only information but also a seamless interactive experience. Ti-He Healthcare, a company specializing in dental services, recognized this need and decided to upgrade their official website.

They first approached `Morpheus International Brand Consultancy`, a professional branding consultancy firm, to assist in repositioning and redesigning their brand image. Through `Morpheus`'s recommendation, I had the opportunity to participate in this website development project, engaging in design discussions and primarily responsible for the technical implementation.

Ti-He Healthcare wanted their website to not only provide basic company information but also showcase their professional skills and service range. Their goal was to attract not only general customers needing dental care but also to highlight their exceptional implant technology and techniques, thereby attracting more peers or related vendors, and providing existing customers with a convenient information platform.

### Technology Choices

For the website development, we chose HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the main technologies. These technologies not only allow for high customization but also ensure fast loading and a great user experience. Various JavaScript techniques were applied to enhance the interactivity and performance of the website.

- **HTML** and **CSS**: Responsible for the website's structure and style design, and through CSS, meeting RWD requirements to ensure consistent visual effects across different devices.

- **JavaScript**: Used to enhance website interactivity by implementing various dynamic effects and features such as responsive navigation menus, content sliding, and image carousels.

### JavaScript Features Explained

1. **Global Event Listener**: By using the `addGlobalEventListener` function, we can easily add event listeners across the entire website, making the code more concise and maintainable.

2. **Throttle Function**: Utilized the `throttle` function to limit the frequency of high-frequency events, improving website performance, especially during scrolling and sliding operations.

3. **ARIA Attribute Management**: Dynamically managed ARIA attributes through `ArilExpanded` and `ArilExpandedFalse` functions to enhance website accessibility.

4. **Responsive Navigation Menu**: Implemented animated hamburger menus and click events to ensure a good navigation experience across different devices.

5. **Dropdown Menu Functionality**: Applied to mobile devices, controlling the display and hiding of dropdown menus through click events.

6. **Scroll Effects**: Used `IntersectionObserver` to monitor elements entering the viewport, achieving fade-in effects during scrolling.

7. **Image Carousel**: Implemented image carousel functionality across multiple pages, supporting swipe and click transitions with automatic looping.

8. **Side Navigation**: Implemented side navigation across multiple pages, automatically highlighting the navigation link of the current section when scrolling.

9. **Drag and Scroll Interactions**: Implemented drag and scroll view functionality on certain pages to enhance user interaction experience.

10. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured consistent website performance across different browsers through custom `requestAnimationFrame` implementation.

### Development Process

- **Requirement Analysis**: Engaged in in-depth communication with `Morpheus International Brand Consultancy` and Ti-He Healthcare's team to understand their needs and expectations, and formulated a detailed development plan.
- **Prototype Design**: Designed the website prototype and repeatedly confirmed with the client.
- **Feature Development**: Used JavaScript to implement various interactive features, ensuring the website's dynamics and responsiveness.
- **Testing and Optimization**: Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure performance and compatibility across different devices and browsers.

### Conclusion

Unfortunately, due to the client's own considerations and time constraints, I was not involved in the final stages and launch of this project. However, from my perspective, I believe we successfully created a fully functional and user-friendly website for Ti-He Healthcare. After confirmation with `Morpheus International Brand Consultancy`, they agreed that I can showcase the parts I contributed to on non-commercial, personal platforms.
