A representative work in the field of video games, [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man), is an arcade game developed by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco).

Inspired by this classic game, I used the native Canvas API to create a simple version of a Pac-Man mini-game.
This project serves as a learning experience and demonstration of how to use the Canvas API for game development.

I hope this mini-game can evoke fond memories of Pac-Man and bring some fun to everyone.
