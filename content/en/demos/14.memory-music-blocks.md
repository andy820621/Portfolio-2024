This is a simple memory game developed using the Vue framework, designed to challenge players' memory and reaction skills. At the start of each level, a series of colorful blocks are displayed sequentially, accompanied by unique sound effects. Players need to carefully observe and listen, remembering the order in which the blocks appear and the corresponding sounds.

After the display ends, the player's task is to click on the blocks in the correct order, recreating the previous color and sound combinations based on the hints. As the levels progress, the number of blocks and the speed of changes will gradually increase, further testing the player's memory and concentration.

This game not only provides entertainment but also serves as an interesting tool to enhance memory, suitable for players of all ages to challenge themselves and improve their memory skills.
