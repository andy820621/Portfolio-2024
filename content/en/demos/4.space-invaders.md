When it comes to the most classic shooting mini-games, we have to mention [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), which was released by Japan's Taito Corporation in 1978.

It was also a game I loved very much as a child. Therefore, I want to use the canvas API to recreate a simple version of Space Invaders.

P.S. The recently launched Space Invaders Extreme is now available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/744050/Space_Invaders_Extreme/?).
