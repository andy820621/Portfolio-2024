Early computer games, in my opinion, the most classic ones are the "NS-" series!
For example, "NS-SHAFT" and "NS-TOWER," which were developed by Akihiko Kusanagi. (If you're interested, you can follow his [Twitter](https://x.com/nagix?prefetchTimestamp=1728723781366) or [Github](https://github.com/nagix).)

In addition to the program versions, there were also Flash versions later on, but they can no longer be played.

Therefore, I want to use the native canvas API to create a simple version of "NS-SHAFT".
