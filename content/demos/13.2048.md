Recently, I've been very addicted to playing a mobile game called 2048. It's a sliding puzzle game where the goal is to merge tiles with the same numbers on a 4x4 grid to eventually reach the target of 2048.

However, being overly addicted to games isn't a good thing, so I thought about recreating 2048 myself using native JavaScript.
