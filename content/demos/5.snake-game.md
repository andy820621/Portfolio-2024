Snake, originating from the 1976 arcade game Blockade, is one of the most classic games in gaming history.
Its interface and style feature a typical 2D, grid-based design, making it very suitable for development using the native Canvas API.
Therefore, I want to create a simple version of Snake, accompanied by simple music to enhance the tension of the game.

Incidentally, since its release, Snake has undergone numerous updates, adding new features and advanced gameplay, offering more challenges and fun.
If you're interested, you might consider online multiplayer versions like [Snake.io](https://snake.io/),
or the [Google Maps Snake Game](https://snake.googlemaps.com/), which allows you to navigate through different cities around the world.
