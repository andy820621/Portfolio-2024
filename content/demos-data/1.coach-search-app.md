This project is a code education matchmaking platform developed using Vue3, with Firebase as the database.

The main functionality of the platform is to allow users to register as either teachers or students.

Students can search for and contact teachers who offer specific languages or course content they wish to learn.

Teachers can showcase their teaching methods and unique features for students to consider and can also see which students have contacted them.

The platform aims to facilitate effective matchmaking and communication between teachers and students, enhancing both learning and teaching experiences.
